# BLOBFISH
################################################################################################################
#THE JOURNEY
#For the first few weeks, we took the code of flappy bird and tried to understand it to see if we can recreate it.
#After that, the first week we started with the scrolling background. The code was taken from CODEPLYLET. We also created the art for the blobfish and background.
#After, we implemented for the controls of the blobfish. We spent a couple weeks trying to make the blobfish move and keep it from moving outside the window.
#After, we made the art for the bombs and got them to move across the screen. This took a while to complete. We wanted to figure out how to randomly generate a bomb in whichever lane to go across the #screen. After this, We worked on the collisions with the bomb. We found many videos on collisions, but we ended up using code similar to codepylet's collision rect video.
#There were many problemns that arose with trying to blit the bombs and move it. There were many conditionals set to allow the bombs to move across.
#After the bomb, we developed the game to where the game would not close after the fish died. We would keep the loop running and display a gameover menu and start menu. Pressing escape would clsoe it.
#After this, we implemented the oxygen bar and points. We used code similar to Mr. Cozort's idea of a health bar. As well, we took code similar to the original flappy bird to display how many points the #user had. After this, I tidied up the code and comments.
