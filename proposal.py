#Our Group proposal

#Our project is creating a game similar to flappy bird called blobby fish.
#He has to avoid obstacles in the ocean by using up and down keys.
#Our first major milestone is udnerstanding the code within the flappy bird python game. We will use it as reference for our game.
#We need to learn how to use pygae and develop the settings for the game. As well, we need to fogure out all the resources we will use for the game.
#Our project is too ambitious trying to include different character shades and developing a random obstacle generator and trying to overall create different lanes for the blob fish.
#It is not ambitious enough because it is very simple in the fact we are trying to base our game off of something already made.
